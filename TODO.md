fix direct/md links in components

keep fonts in asset management?
    -fonts have mixed management due to preloading
-deployment as full copy?


show component links to test
generate tests as well


edit page/source links

align bug when generating?

empty pages on server (to save space) ?

link inside module (#hash to headlines)

- utility, transition, table, parallax, overlay, marker

- prevent marked from damaging preprocessed examples
    -prevent form adding <p> inside html
